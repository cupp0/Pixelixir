# Pixelixir

This is a tool you can use to make DSP (digital signal processing, think images, audio) tools. Point and click to connect modules (a la Pure Data / Max) until you like what you see. Then encapsulate that behaviour in a new module and keep building bigger.

At the moment, you should be able to just install Processing and run. Lots of change happening now, so stability / usefulness isn't there quite yet. Planning on a big push in january so we can start mangling images and making noises soon.

"This is the computer graphics equivilent of a musical synth. Its reciple is equal parts flexibility, discovery, and raw power. It will reward your curiousity and question your intentions." - my friend
